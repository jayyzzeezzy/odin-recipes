        <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>These savory-sweet shrimp skewers are easy to make and cook in just a few minutes. 
                They are ideal for summer nights. Party, BBQ, family dinner, it is good for all occasions.  
                You may prep the sauce ahead of time for a faster dinner. 
                I prefer to use jumbo shrimp (21 to 25 per pound), however use what you have on hand.

                <li>Combine water, soy sauce, brown sugar, honey, garlic, and ginger in a small saucepan and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. 
                    Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until sauce has reduced and thickened slightly, 8 to 10 minutes.</li>
                <li>
                    Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil grate. 
                    Thread shrimp and pineapple alternately onto skewers and place on a platter.</li>
                <li>Arrange skewers on the hot grate. 
                    Grill 2 to 3 minutes per side, or until shrimp is opaque and cooked through. 
                    Turn grill to low heat and brush sauce on both sides of skewers.
