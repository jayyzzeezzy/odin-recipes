        <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>These savory-sweet shrimp skewers are easy to make and cook in just a few minutes. 
                They are ideal for summer nights. Party, BBQ, family dinner, it is good for all occasions.  
                You may prep the sauce ahead of time for a faster dinner. 
                I prefer to use jumbo shrimp (21 to 25 per pound), however use what you have on hand.
